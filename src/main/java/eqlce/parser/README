Requirements:
- Java 1.8
- json-simple-1.1.jar (already in folder "lib" so just add as an external jar in the build Path of the project)

Instructions for testing:
- Place json file in folder "jsonFile" which is in folder "eql"
- open java file "TestWithJsonFile.java" and set the name of file if needed. By default, there is an jsonFile file as input for testing named "jsonFileForSensorNetwork.json" 
and put the name of output file (optional) (ex: mongoFile.mongo)
- import it in eclipse as a java project and execute file "TestWithJsonFile.java"
